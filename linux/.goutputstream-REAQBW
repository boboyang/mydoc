#remeber, use --help or man, with grep, to learn by use, not by memorize
#ex, i remember grep can show lines ahead or after, so i use:
grep --help|grep line
#then i can use:
man script |grep arg -A3 -B3 -n

#terminal
Shift+Ctrl+C: copy  
Shift+Ctrl+V: paste

#linux version
uname -r

#history
!grep		#show all history cmd start with grep

#man shutdown
shutdown
